Deploying VM
========================
Setting up and spinning up your vagrant machine doesn't take much and there is minimal code invovled. To set up your vagrant machine, open up powershell and navigate to the location/folder you want to create your vagrant box.
With a single command, vagrant will create a new configuration file for you. See command below:
```
vagrant init
```
